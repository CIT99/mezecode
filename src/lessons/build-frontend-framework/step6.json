  "description": "Congratulations! You've built a working framework. Now let's use it to create a complete page with multiple elements.\n\n**What you need to do:**\n- Export an `appTree` that contains:\n  - An `h1` tag with a heading\n  - A `p` tag with some paragraph text\n  - An `a` tag (link) with `href` pointing to a URL and `target=\"_blank\"` to open in a new tab\n  - A `button` with an `onClick` handler (optional, but shown in the example)\n\n**Important:** The `createElement` and `render` functions are provided for you in the preview. You just need to export an `appTree` using `exports.createElement`!\n\n**Example structure:**\n```javascript\nexports.appTree = exports.createElement(\n  'div',\n  {},\n  exports.createElement('h1', {}, 'Welcome!'),\n  exports.createElement('p', {}, 'Create your h1, p, a, and button elements!'),\n  exports.createElement('a', { href: 'https://example.com', target: '_blank' }, 'Example Link'),\n  exports.createElement('button', { onClick: () => alert('Almost there!') }, 'Click me')\n);\n```\n\n**Tips:**\n- Use `exports.createElement` to build your tree structure\n- Nest elements as children by passing them as additional arguments to `createElement`\n- For the link, make sure to include both `href` and `target` in the props object\n- The root element should be a `div` that contains all your other elements\n- Feel free to add more elements and experiment! Try different tags, styles, or event handlers.\n\n**Have fun!** This is your chance to play around with the framework you built. Add images, lists, forms, or anything else you can think of!"
