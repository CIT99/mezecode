## Hint: Change the Text

### What You Need to Do

This is a simple first step! The framework code is already complete and working. You just need to find the text "Hello World" and change it to "Hello CIT84".

### Where to Look

Look for this line in the code:
```javascript
const element = exports.createElement('div', {}, 'Hello World');
```

### What to Change

Change `'Hello World'` to `'Hello CIT84'`:
```javascript
const element = exports.createElement('div', {}, 'Hello CIT84');
```

### Why This Step?

This step helps you:
1. See the framework working right away
2. Understand how `createElement` and `render` work together
3. Get a quick win before we start building from scratch

### Tips

- Change "Hello World" to "Hello CIT84"
- The text will appear in the preview panel
- Make sure to keep the quotes around your text
